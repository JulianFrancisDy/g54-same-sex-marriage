						<h2>Here's an overview of our project.</h2>
						<p>The SOGIE Bill has encountered strong opposition due to the controversy surrounding its implementation in a predominantly Catholic country. In light of this, this research was sought out to examine if there is a prominent group responsible for propagating misinformation or disinformation regarding the provisions of the bill on Twitter. </p>

						<h2>Data Exploration</h2>
            <p>We explore the data that we've collected to make sure they are aligned with the objectives of our study.</p>
					</header>
          <hr>
          <h3>Data Collection</h3>
          <p>We mined the internet for fake news data. We obtained tweets manually and by using a Python script. Since we want to explore the tweets which spread mis/disinformation about the SOGIE Bill, these are the keywords that we used to collect tweets: <b>"SOGIE Bill", "#NoToSOGIE", "#JunkSOGIEBill"</b> Note that these keywords are not case sensitive and may be separated i.e. "sogie" and "bill" were also used as keywords.</p>
          <hr>
          <div>
            <h3>Data Structure Overview</h3>
            <p>
              The group was able to collect <b>128 samples</b> with <b>37 features</b> from <b>81 unique Twitter accounts.</b> Note that not all of these features might be relevant to the the study, and will be discussed later on. Moreover, some features have also been added to help analyze the data in the context of the study's research question.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <hr>
            <h3>Data Cleaning and Formatting</h3>
						<p align="justify">Out of the 37, the features with the highest percentage of null values are:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type:none" align="justify">
              <li>Remarks:  99.22%</li>

              <li>Christian Keyword: 53.13%</li>
            </ul>
            <p align="justify">Since these features are not necessarily relevant to our hypothesis, we ignore these null values for now. We show some features and their type in the table below.</p>

            <h3>Data Visualization</h3>
						<p align="justify">Our study aims to compare the <b>Christian and non-Christian</b> tweets that have vocally opposed and have spread mis/disinformation about the SOGIE Bill in the Philippines. For this purpose, we manually tagged tweets and profiles as Christian and non-Christian based on the following rules. Note that Christian keywords were taken from this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_Christianity">Glossary of Christian terms</a>.</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type:circle" align="justify">
              <li>If the Twitter profile (bio, name, username) contains a Christian keyword.</li>
              <li>If the tweet contains a Christian keyword.</li>
              <li>If the profile has been previously tagged as "Christian."</li>
            </ul>
            <p align="justify">We show the count of the Christian and non-Christian tweets in the chart below.</p> 
            <div class="img-container">
              <img src="images/132_2.png" class="resize-img">
            </div>
            <p align="justify">We observe that the number of tweets tagged as Christian is more than the non-Christian tweets. Exploring the numerical features of the Christian and non-Christian tweets, we can also compare the tweets' engagement and interaction.</p>
            <div class="img-container">

            <p align="justify"><br/>In the table above, we can observe that Christian tweets have a higher mean value compared to the non-Christian tweets in terms of engagements. Which includes <b>Likes, Retweets, Replies, and Quote Tweets.</b> Even though non-Christian tweets have a higher mean value of Followers.</p>
            <p align="justify">Moreover, we can also compare the account types of the Christian and non-Christian tweets. We show the distribution in the figure below.</p>
            <div class="img-container">

            <div>
              We can also check which keywords appear more frequently in the profile bios and tweets in the dataset. We do this by using the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) library. We also include Filipino stopwords taken from <a href="https://github.com/stopwords-iso/stopwords-tl">this library</a>. The most common keywords in the tweets and bios are shown below.

					<div>
						<h3>Topic Modelling</h3>
						<p> Topic Modelling is a statistical modelling technicque which makes use of unsupervised Machine Learning to idnetify thematic patterns from a collection of words or phrases from texts. </p>
						<p> The researchers employed Topic Modelling on the Account Biographies to observe whether these biographies exhibit themes or topics relating to specific religions. </p>

						<div class="img-container">
							<img src="images/dm_1.png" style="max-width:100%"class="resize-img">
						</div>

						<p> The researchers have set the Topic Model to group the biographies into 5 topics. </p>
						<p> By grouping these biogrpahies, we can gain insight on the self-perceptions and associations of the Twitter users, as account biogprahies can serve as their personal descriptions.</p>

                  contains the keywords <i>conservative, filipino, traditional, blessed,</i> which would suggest words that would describe their self <strong>Cultural Identity</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span style = "color:#EB3F1B; font-weight: bold;"> Topic 2</span>

                  contains the keywords <i>love, krist, bible, jesus, people, ps374, john,</i> which strongly suggest these pertain to the users' <strong>faith</strong>, with keywords referring to the Christian Religion along with bible verses and chapters.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span style = "color:#AB63FA; font-weight: bold;"> Topic 4</span>
                  contains the keywords <i>love, katotohanan, bayan, diyos,</i> which could refer to their <strong>passion</strong> to love, truth, country, Jesus, and the like.

                  <span style = "color:#FFA15A; font-weight: bold;"> Topic 5</span>
                  contains the keywords <i>antiwokes, antifakenews, antisupidity, prouddds,feministisantiwoman,</i> which can be grouped as their <strong>advocacies</strong> which alarmingly suggest hate speech.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
						<div style="text-align: left;">
							<p> It is important to note that despite being grouped into different topics, <strong>4 out of 5 topics</strong> contain a keyword pertaining to Christianity suggesting its prominence in how these Twitter Users describe themselves.</p>

					<div>
						<h3>Chi-Square Test</h3>
						<p>  </p>
						<p> To verify whether the resulting topic modelling have <b>significant association between topic and religious affiliations</b>, a chi-square test is performed. This test will assess the independence between the resulting topics.</p>
						<p> Reiterating the null and alternate hypothesis:</p>
						<p> <b>Null hypothesis:</b> There is NO association between the topics and religious affiliations.</p>
						<p> <b>Alternate hypothesis:</b> There is STRONG association between the topics and religious affiliations.</p>
            <div class="img-container">
              <img src="images/dist.png" class="resize-img">
            </div>
						<p> The result from the test is the p-value which will be the basis for accepting or rejecting the hypothesis. A p-value of less than the significance level of 0.05 would provide the evidence to reject the null hypothesis.</p>

						<h3> Statistical Analysis Result </h3>
						<p> Prior to performing the Chi-Square test, <b>Shapiro-Wilk and Anderson-Darling</b> tests were performed to verify normal distribution among the topics. The results from both tests indicated that the topics were found to be normally distributed. </p>
						<p> The results from the Chi-Square test returned a <b>Test Statistic of 248</b>, <b>P-value of 1.33e-43</b>, <b>Degrees of Freedom of 16</b>.</p>
						<p> The extremely small P-value would provide the evidence to reject the null hypothesis. This is further supported by the large test statistic which also indicates deviation from the null hypothesis. </p>

            <p> Given this, <b>Topic 4</b> is the cluster with a higher number of tweets compared to the other topics. </p>

            <div style="margin: 0 auto; text-align: center; width: 700px;">
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">
              Thus, Twitter accounts who post mis/disinformation about the SOGIE Bill commonly have the theme of passion in their profile bios.

						<h2>Results and Insights.</h2>
					</header>

					<div>
						<h3></h3>
						<p>Findings from the Topic Modelling was the <b>prominence of Christian keywords</b> in the way that these Twitter Users would describe themselves in their biographies. </p>
						<p>This is supported through the statistical analysis performed which indicates <b>strong association between the account biographies topics and Christianity.</b></p>
						<p>
							This research <b>sought to understand the online
							discourse surrounding the SOGIE Bill </b> and its
							intersection with religious beliefs by identifying
							religious themes among Twitter accounts opposing the
							bill and spreading mis/disinformation
						</p>
						<p>
							From the results it was <b>identified that religious themes
							are prominent</b> among the Twitter accounts known to
							have tweeted mis/disinformation surrounding the bill,
							suggesting affiliation with the Christian faith.
						</p>

						<p> The findings contribute to a better understanding of <b>challenges in promoting the SOGIE Bill in a predominantly Catholic country</b>. It emphasizes the need to address and counter mis/disinformation campaigns that hinder inclusive legislation. The research provides valuable insights for policymakers, activists, and advocates, fostering dialogue, promoting tolerance, and addressing concerns of different religious communities in the context of gender equality.
						</p>

						<p>Ultimately, this research fosters informed discussions, evidence-based decision-making, and greater inclusivity in the pursuit of equal rights, <b>regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, or religious beliefs</b>.
