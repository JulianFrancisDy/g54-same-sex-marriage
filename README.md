# how to git 
1. Clone the repo 
``` git clone repo link ```
2. Create a new branch for the changes you have in mind 
```git checkout -b new-branch ```
3. After making changes locally, you can test the site by opening `index.html`
4. Stage changes and commit 
```
git add . (for staging all changes)
git commit -m "commit message"
git push -u origin new-branch
```
5. Create PR describing your change

⚠️ Please DON'T merge to the main branch unless everyone in the group has seen your changes/request :) ty ty
